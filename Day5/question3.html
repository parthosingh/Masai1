<!-- In javascript promise is a object that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous opertaion and it resulting value it 
provide a more structured and efficient way to handle asynchronous operitons compared to using call back functions.
when we are calling any fetch api it take some time there we use promise so we can see that data is resolved or rejected or it is 
in pending state.

we excute a promise by using new keyword and then Promise here inside callback function we use resolve or rejected  inside it.
After that inside the setTimeout we use redolve if promise resolve then it will print the statement insode it or else it will
print reject statement.
and then we can handle the promise by using .then and .catch

callback hell is a situation in jvascript where multiple nested callback make the code hard to read and maintain, it happens when you have many 
asynchronous operations depending on each other creating a pyramid of deeply nested struture. 

Promise make the code easy to read and follow compared to nested callback which can get messy and hard to undersand
promise allow you to use async await which make asynchronous code look like regular synchronous code.
Promise allow you to chain task one after the another making it easier to handle multiple asynchronous operations. -->
